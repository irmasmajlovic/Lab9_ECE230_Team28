## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.

It takes multiple inputs and passes one input depending on the value(s) of it's selector(s)

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.

It takes one input and maps it to one of multiple outputs depending on the value(s) of it's selector(s)

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)

Muxs and demuxs are useful because through Shannon's theorem they let us break down boolean logic into demuxs or muxs which enables us to manipulate data in new ways like through selectors.
